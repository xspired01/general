# General

## Summary
This is a general collection of tips, techniques, and pointers of the nuance of JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. 

### Background
All of these tips, pointers, and techniques are available through Stackoverflow, MDN, Python docs, blogposts, Medium, etc, etc. However, sometimes there too many results and it's hard to review all.  This is a general collection of condensed tips of different languages and different concepts. Some of the concepts that will be covered are equality in JavaScript (== vs === vs Object.is(element1,element2)), implicit conversion in JavaScript, iterating through the length of a Python list (JavaScript array), etc, etc.
